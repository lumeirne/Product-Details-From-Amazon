1. **Import Required Libraries:**
   - Install the Required libraries from requirements.txt
   - You import the necessary libraries, including `requests` for making HTTP requests, `pandas` for working with CSV data, `time` for measuring elapsed time, `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML, and `json` for handling JSON data.

2. **Defining a Function for Scraping Product Details:**
   - A function `scrape_product_details(url)` that takes a URL as input and scrapes product details from that URL.
   - This function sends an HTTP GET request to the URL with custom headers to mimic a web browser.
   - It checks the response status code and, if successful (status code 200), parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
   - The function extracts product details such as title, image URL, price, and product description from the HTML.
   - If any errors occur during the process, the function handles them and prints an error message.

3. **Specify Headers:**
   - Custom headers to include in our HTTP requests. These headers mimic those of a web browser to avoid detection as a scraper.

4. **Read ASIN and Country Data from CSV:**
   - Specify the path to a CSV file (`asin_country_Csv`) containing ASIN and country data.
   - Create an empty list called `data` to store the scraped product details.

5. **Batch Processing of URLs:**
   - Read the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame (`df`) to access the ASIN and country data.
   - Set a batch size (`batch_size`) to process URLs in batches for efficiency.
   - Start a timer to measure the elapsed time for processing.

6. **Loop through Batches and URLs:**
   - loop through the DataFrame in batches, with each batch containing a portion of the ASINs and countries.
   - For each URL in the batch, you construct the Amazon product URL based on the country and ASIN.
   - Call the `scrape_product_details` function to scrape product details from the URL.
   - If the scraping is successful (product details are obtained), you append the details to the `data` list.

7. **Measure Elapsed Time:**
   - After processing each batch of URLs, you calculate and print the elapsed time.

8. **Save Scraped Data to JSON:**
   - Once all URLs have been processed, you save the scraped product details in a JSON file (`scraped_data.json`) using the `json.dump` method.

9. **Print Summary:**
   - Finally, print the total number of URLs scraped.

This approach efficiently scrapes product details from Amazon product pages while handling errors and providing feedback on the progress. It's structured well for handling a large number of URLs in batches, which can be useful for web scraping tasks.
